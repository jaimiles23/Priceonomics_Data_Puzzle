Challenge: Tell us the median price of booking a room in each of the top 100 cities in this data set. 


Stated Considerations:
- More specifically, send us back a table with a list of the median price in each city, ranked from most to least expensive. 
- Restrict your analysis to just to the \"top 100\" cities that have the most units on the market.


Extra Considerations:
- There may be duplicate city names in different states. 
  I will handle this by first grouping cities & states and then counting cities.
  NOTE: Some of these duplicates may be from data entry, e.g., Berkeley, CO is a city neighborhood.

- Don't assume that all data has uniform input.
  After working with the data, I discovered case inconsistencies, 
  e.g., New York, NY vs new york, NY. In analysis, I considered these the same cities.

- Some locations may be listed under different names. 
  After grouping the data, I noticed that Miami and Miami beach are both listed. 
  With some research, I decided to group the two separately.

# Additional Analysis -----------------------------------------------------

# Indianapolis, IN
##########
"
I did not expect Indianapolis, IN to have the highest median price.
I expected it to be high, but I consider it curious that it ranks higher than  
more populous, globally recognized cities like Los Angeles, and New York.
This is where specific domain knowledge, e.g., about the housing market, would 
be useful to understand the data.

Because the median is a robust statistic, the calculated unit price for Indianapolis, IN 
is not affected by outliers. I would be interested to closer inspect the city's data quartiles.
It is possible that the data follows a bimodal distribution, and there are more rentals offered 
in the higher pricing cluster. This would explain a higher median.
"
data_indianapolis_in <- data_treefortbnb %>% 
  filter(state == "in", city == "indianapolis")

View(data_indianapolis_in)

data_indianapolis_in %>% 
  summarise(
    num_units = n(),
    mean_cost = mean(price_USD),
    st_dev = sd(price_USD),
    min_price = min(price_USD),
    max_price = max(price_USD)
  )

"Note: slight difficulties with quantiles in dplyr. Need to pre-define quantiles, names, and functions before running."
percents <- c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)    # define quantiles of interest
perc_names <- map_chr(percents, ~paste0(.x * 100, "%"))   # Create quantile names.
p_funcs <- map(percents, ~ partial(quantile, probs = .x, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  set_names(nm = perc_names)
p_funcs


data_indianapolis_in %>% 
  summarise_at(
    vars(price_USD), funs(!!!p_funcs)
  )


"
Wow! Maximum price of $5,500 and q3 at $1,200. Something is definitely happening with the
treehouse market in Indianapolis.
"

ggplot(data = data_indianapolis_in, mapping = aes(x = price_USD)) + 
  geom_boxplot()


"
There are quite a few outliers past 2,000 USD.
The spirit of a central measure (median above) is to get something normal. 
With 251 observations, I still would not call anything in excess of $2,000 normal.

Let's plot this data vs the number of reviews.
"
colnames(data_indianapolis_in)
ggplot(data = data_indianapolis_in, 
       mapping = aes(x = price_USD, y = num_reviews)
       ) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Price vs num reviews in Indianapolis, IN")

"
The graph shows that prices above $1,000 USD have 0 reviews.
If we consider reviews to be a proxy variable for visits, we can assume that these
units do not constitute normal treefortBnb experiences.

# Investigate cities outside top 100

lower_median_cost_per_city <- tail(median_cost_per_city, 24)
View(lower_median_cost_per_city)
"
Looking at the  median cost per city outside of the top 100, there are 12 cities with a 
single unit available. Many of these cities with a single unit have no reviews, 
while 3/4 of the cities with 2 units have 10+ reviews.

Many of these cities are duplicate names, e.g., Berkeley, CO. 
Upon further investigation, I discovered that Berkeley is a neighborhood city in Denver.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_Denver

I would be interested in double checking these low-entry units for clerical errors.
In the case of Berkeley, CO, this may reflect the data entry system and the correct
city is Berkeley, CA.
